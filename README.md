# Payflip

PayFlip is a platform that seamlessly converts local currency payments into stablecoin settlements, bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance.

# What it does:
- Enables users to make payments in their local currency (e.g., via M-Pesa)
- Automatically converts payments to stablecoins for merchant settlements
- Integrates KotaniAPI for stablecoin settlements and  fiat collections
- Simplifies the on/off-ramp process for cryptocurrency transactions


## Inspiration  ðŸ’¡

The inspiration for PayFlip comes from recognizing the growing potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, while also acknowledging the barriers that prevent widespread adoption. The vision is to create a bridge between traditional financial systems and the emerging world of digital assets, making crypto more accessible and practical for everyday use.

### Problem Statement
The  problem PayFlip aims to solve is the complexity and inefficiency in the current landscape of cross-border payments and crypto adoption. Specifically:

- Crypto Adoption Barrier: The process of acquiring and using cryptocurrencies remains complex for many everyday users, hindering widespread adoption.
- On/Off-Ramp Complexity: Existing on-ramp and off-ramp processes for cryptocurrency transactions are often complicated and time-consuming, discouraging potential users.
- Currency Volatility: Merchants in regions with volatile local currencies face financial risks when accepting payments.
- Integration Challenges: There's a lack of seamless integration between traditional payment systems and blockchain-based financial solutions.


### How It Works
PayFlip operates as a bridge between local currency payments and stablecoin settlements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

- User Payment:

A user makes a payment in their local currency (e.g., Kenyan Shillings via M-Pesa).
The payment is processed through KotaniPay Collections  API.


- Currency Conversion:

Payment is confirmed and the get an onramp rate from KOtaniAPI's and calculate the stablecoin amount to be settled.


- Stablecoin Settlement:

The system interacts with KotaniPay's API to facilitate the stablecoin transaction.
The equivalent amount of stablecoin is transferred to the merchant's wallet.


- Confirmation:

Both the user and the merchant receive confirmations of the completed transaction.
The merchant can now access the stablecoin in their wallet.



### Tech Stack

Frontend:

Next.js: React framework for building the user interface
Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design
Wagmi: For Ethereum (Base) interactions in the frontend


#### Backend:

Next.js API Routes: For server-side logic and API endpoints


#### API and Integrations:

Kotani API: For handling local currency collections, on-ramp processes, and stablecoin settlements


#### Blockchain Technologies:

Base: The underlying blockchain infrastructure
Solidity: For writing smart contracts
onchainkit: For smart wallet management and blockchain interactions
Base Names: For human-readable wallet addresses

###  ðŸš§ Challenges ðŸš§
Integrating BaseNames and smart wallet was a challenge. Also handling all the transactions of a deposit and settlement seamlessly proved to be a hard nut to crack.
With the use of Onchainkit I was able to integrate Smart wallet with ease and using of asynchronous calls i handled payment and status checking on the transaction seamlessly


### What Next For Vetra Cloud
- Enabling more stablecoins for payouts. (Currently accepting USDC $ USDT)
- Accepting more local currencies for Collections (Currently accepting KES $ GHS)
